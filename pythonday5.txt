diff bet python 2 and python 3
				python 2					python 3
1) print function     print does not comes with parentises		print fun comes with perantices
			print "Hello World"						print("Hello World")

if we write print fun in python 3 without peranthises it will show syntax error

2) range fun  		for loop comes with xrange fun 			for loop comes with range fun
	

3) divison operation  	in python 2 division takes floor (/) division 	python 3 has simple(/) division and floor (//)division

in python 2 for integer it will floor the number i.e 2.5=2
-2.5=-3
for foating points number it will give floation point no
print 5.0/2=2.5
print 5/2= 2
